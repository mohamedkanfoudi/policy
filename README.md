Welcome to the Hadithapp2022 (حفظ الحديث النبوي) for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Mohamed EL Kanfoudi.The app is  available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like password ,emails  etc.)) created by you is stored on a database in  Hassania School of Publics Works servers.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Mohamed EL Kanfoudi.
Casablanca, Morocco.
